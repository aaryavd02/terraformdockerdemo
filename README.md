# Terraform Docker Demo 

# Description
This is a Terraform Docker Demo. In the **main.tf** configuration file, we create a Nginx Docker Container.

# How to Provision
* Execute the command **"terraform init"** to initialize the working directory and download the Terraform Docker Provider
* Execute the command **"terraform apply"** to provision the infrastructure. The current setup will provision the container on Docker desktop
* The infrastructure can be destroyed using **"terraform destroy"** command
